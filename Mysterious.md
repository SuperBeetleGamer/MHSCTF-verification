## Mysterious
We can immediately tell this is a befunge esolang because it's in the rev category and doesn't look like brainfuck. It starts off by doing simple arithmetic to create key ascii shifts of the flag combination on the bottom left. Here are some helpful links [wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Befunge) and [interpretor](https://www.quirkster.com/iano/js/befunge.html) We can also see that just every time the cursor reaches `p`, the value on the bottom left changes when we add random characters so we know both the length of the flag and how it's being checked (though it's not very clear since the flag checker is just a bunch of random characters). Then we just figure out the offset of each character and it's value and solve for the flag.
