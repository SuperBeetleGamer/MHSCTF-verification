Alright for this challenge, stemming from the previous one, we know that it has to data of either an image/video. Fortunately, we knew that this was image because this ctf is beginner friendly and reconstructing videos would be much to difficult.
Time for googling about what these mean!!
After about 10 hours of nonstop googling, we finally landed on SVG which turned out to be correct!!!
I didn't know too much about SVG so I ended up using a user-friendly website that automatically converted the data into SVG data into pictures which was then turned into the flag!
